From raw data to executive insights — automated capacity forecasting for colocation data centres.

---

## 📘 Overview
This repository provides a robust, automated pipeline for **capacity reporting and forecasting** in colocation data centers. It transforms raw Excel inputs into enriched datasets, applies advanced forecasting models, and integrates with **Power BI dashboards** to deliver clear, actionable insights on utilization, efficiency, and future capacity trends.

The project bridges **data engineering** and **executive-ready reporting**, enabling organizations to move beyond static spreadsheets toward scalable, AI-driven workflows.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- 🔄 **Automated ETL**: Cleans and enriches raw operational data.
- 📈 **Forecasting Engine**: Uses Prophet and Pandas to predict rack utilization and load efficiency.
- 📊 **Power BI Dashboards**: Interactive visualizations for executives and stakeholders.
- ⚡ **Hybrid Workflow**: Seamlessly integrates local Excel files, VPS-based processing, and cloud-ready outputs.
- 🛡️ **Maintainability**: Modular scripts, clear directory structure, and `.gitignore` rules to keep the repo lightweight.
